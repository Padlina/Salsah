From the list view (grid, list or tableView) the user can select more
than one resource (well known from e-mail applications). In that case,
an additional header provides some tools to do something with the
selected resources. If the user selects some resources which are from
the same resource type, he can edit them by one click. A modal box shows
the properties of the selected resources. It’s the same process as
Apple’s iTunes has (s. Fig. [fig:itunes]).

   a modal box, where the user can edit the properties for the whole
   selection.
