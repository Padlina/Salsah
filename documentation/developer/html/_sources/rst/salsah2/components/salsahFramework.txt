salsahFramework
===============

The main SALSAH app component is the framework module which builds the default layout template with

    - salsahHeader (Fig. \ref{fig:header}) with
        - project selection and settings menu
        - search bar panel incl. simple and extended search
        - import menu (add resources and create collections)
        - documentation menu (link to the documentation and/or cheat sheet)
        - user menu (profile setting, log out etc.)

    - salsahFacetedSearch on the left hand side

    - salsahView as a main container for salsahSearchResults, the graph and resource viewer, dashboard etc. The salsahView would be the frame for the ng2 router-outlet.

    - salsahFooter (?)
